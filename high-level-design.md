# High-Level Design (Using Django for Frontend and Backend)

## 1. System Architecture
- **Frontend**: Django's templating engine for server-side HTML rendering and serving static files for CSS and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Django framework for all backend operations including business logic, authentication, form validation, and ORM for database interactions.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for its robustness and advanced features.

## 2. Application Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing containerized applications, ensuring scalability and high availability.

## 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Automation**: Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment pipelines for the Django application.

## 4. Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Django's architecture allows for horizontal scaling with database connection pooling and shared-nothing architecture.
- **Load Balancing**: Use of load balancers to manage traffic and maintain performance during peak loads.

## 5. Security
- **Data Transmission**: Secure communication with HTTPS.
- **User Authentication and Security**: Djangoâ€™s built-in security features to handle authentication, session management, CSRF, and XSS protection.

## 6. Automation of Provisioning
- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: Terraform for automating cloud resource creation.
- **Cloud Services**: Utilization of AWS, Azure, or similar services for application hosting and managed services for scaling and high availability.

## 7. Validation and Data Integrity
- **Backend Validation**: Django forms for email format validation and uniqueness checks for emails and phone numbers.
- **Frontend Validation**: JavaScript for immediate client-side user feedback.

## 8. Monitoring and Logging
- **Application Metrics**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

## 9. Backup and Disaster Recovery
- **Database Backups**: Regular and automated backups with a clear recovery strategy.

## 10. Documentation and Code Management
- **Version Control**: GitHub repository with source code, commit history, and branch management.
- **Setup and Run Instructions**: README file with detailed instructions.
- **Code Comments**: Inline comments and documentation for code maintainability.
- **Design Documentation**: A high-level design document with diagrams in PDF format.

# Justification

This design leverages Django's full-stack capabilities to expedite development by using a single framework for both frontend and backend. It ensures a streamlined process with fewer integration points and a cohesive development experience. The design focuses on best practices for deployment, scalability, and security, aligning with the objective to create a highly available service as per the tech assignment's requirements.
